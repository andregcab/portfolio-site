                  <p class="experience-card__description">
                    I built a React-based content management system
                    that streamlined how our editorial teams publish
                    content globally. I worked closely with designers
                    to create responsive, accessible interfaces using
                    our component system. I helped design our GraphQL
                    schemas and state management architecture to
                    support scalable frontend development. I also
                    focused on creating good documentation to help
                    other teams understand and work with our systems.

                  <p class="experience-card__description">
                    I led a major refactor of our UI codebase that
                    spanned multiple teams, introducing better
                    architecture patterns that made development faster
                    and more reliable. I also designed and built
                    GraphQL APIs to handle complex content management
                    workflows across different platforms. I spend a
                    lot of time mentoring other engineers, helping
                    them grow and improving our overall code quality.
                    I've been working on migrating our older
                    components to TypeScript, which has significantly
                    reduced bugs in our most important user flows. I'm
                    passionate about making our products accessible
                    and performant for millions of users. I also
                    handle on-call rotations and lead discussions when
                    things go wrong, making sure we learn from each
                    incident. I work closely with designers and
                    product teams to improve our user experience and
                    design systems.
